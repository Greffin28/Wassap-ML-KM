Fast foods and junk foods are high in fat, sodium and sugar, which can lead to obesity and a range of attendant health problems, including diabetes, heart disease and arthritis.

As a result, you may feel chronically fatigued and lack the energy you need to complete daily tasks.

Because fast food and junk food don't contain adequate amounts of protein and good carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels will drop suddenly after eating, leaving you feeling grumpy, fatigued and craving sugar.

Junk Food Contributes to Poor Performance and Obesity

Junk food contains large amounts of fat, and as fat accumulates in your body, you'll gain weight and could become obese.

The more weight you gain, the more you'll be at risk for serious chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and arthritis.

Excessive dietary sodium can also have a negative effect on renal function, even leading to kidney disease.

You'll feel tired and have trouble concentrating because your body might not be getting enough oxygen.

Over time, this stress damages your body's ability to use the insulin secreted by your pancrease.

It can lead to mood swings and constipation, and lower your energy levels so that you lack interest in the exercise you need to burn off those extra calories.
