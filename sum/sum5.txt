The concept of Discord came from CEO Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games.

While Fates Forever was not commercially successful due to low popularity, Citron noted the difficulties that his team had in building the game when trying to play other representative games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends to work out gameplay concepts, specifically highlighting issues of current Voice over IP options that were available: some VoIP options required players to share various IP addresses just to connect, while other services like Skype or TeamSpeak were resource-heavy and had known security issues.

This led the developers towards developing a chat service that was much friendlier to use based on more modern technology.

The public release of Discord was in May 2015.

Discord became popular through eSports and LAN tournament gamers and through other Twitch.tv streamers.

The company raised an additional $20 million in funding for the software in January 2016.
