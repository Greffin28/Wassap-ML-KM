Chocolate, according to recent research, may provide a mental boost by elevating blood flow to the brain.

The effect of this is that chocolate may be good for improving one's memory and attention and may be helpful for speeding up reaction times.

Researchers have found that dark chocolate consumption reduces hypertension, reduces cholesterol levels, and adds protection against blood clots.

For athletes, this may come in the form of improved recovery times after periods of exertion and for women this may come in the form of an improved sexual experience (chocolate does seem to be an aphrodesiac in its own right).
