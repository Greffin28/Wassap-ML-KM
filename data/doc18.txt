For many years, the argument regarding the potential health benefits of alcohol has seesawed back and forth. At varying points, it has been declared that moderate alcohol consumption may have the effect of reducing stress and, potentially, decreasing the risk of certain impairments for which stress and anxiety are risk factors.

Most recently, those arguing in favor of moderate alcohol consumption have argued in favor of red wine, a source of the antioxidant chemical, resveratrol. Of course, from a dietetic standpoint, it may be best to limit one's consumption of red wine to meals and to use a wine that is dry to very dry. Reason: to limit the intake of sugar. This is probably wise for all individuals as higher glucose levels contribute to higher insulin resistance levels in a sizeable portion of the population. And, for diabetics, a reduction in carbohydrate consumption, particularly sugar and highly refined carbohydrates, is practical advice.

Aside from obtaining resveratrol in one's dietary intake, are there other health reasons for consuming wine? Possibly. According to a CNN article, (The health pros and cons of drinking), wine drinkers may have a lower future risk for dementia, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.

But are these potential benefits outweighed by the risks of alcohol consumption? Possibly, as well. Alcohol puts pressure on the liver and dehydrates the skin. It also has the potential to increase the risk of breast cancer and to lower bone density levels. And, it is specualted, about a third of adults will have a risk for becoming dependent on alcohol.
